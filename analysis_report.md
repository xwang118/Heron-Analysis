## My Analytical Approach

Given the open-ended nature of "Is Heron working as expected?", I structured my analysis around **4 key dimensions** that would matter most to a banking customer:

1. **Data Coverage** - Are we getting comprehensive metrics for all companies?
2. **Data Quality** - Is the extracted data reliable and complete?
3. **Processing Consistency** - Does the system work reliably across different companies?
4. **Business Value** - Is this actually replacing the manual work as promised?

### Methodology
- **Data Exploration:** Examined structure and coverage of both datasets (metrics.csv and company_metrics.csv)
- **Quality Assessment:** Checked for missing values, outliers, and consistency patterns
- **Coverage Analysis:** Measured metric availability across all companies
- **Business Validation:** Verified financial metrics show reasonable ranges and patterns
- **Impact Synthesis:** Translated technical findings into business value propositions
